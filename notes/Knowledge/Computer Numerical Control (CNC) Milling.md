# Computer Numerical Control (CNC) Milling
    A precise manufacturing process that involves the computer-controlled removal of material from a solid block (e.g., metal, plastic) to produce a part or product.

## Key Features:
- Precision: High levels of accuracy in producing complex shapes and geometries.
- Versatility: Capable of working with a wide range of materials.
- Automation: Computer-controlled, allowing for high repeatability and efficiency in production.

## Applications:
Widely used in manufacturing for creating detailed parts and components with tight tolerances. Ideal for both one-off projects and high-volume production.

## Comparison with [[Rapid Prototyping]]
- Purpose: [[Rapid prototyping]] focuses on speed and flexibility for early-stage design validation, while CNC milling is more about precision manufacturing of final products or components.
- Material Range: [[Rapid prototyping]] technologies, especially 3D printing, can use a wider range of materials, including plastics and resins, whereas CNC milling is often used with metals and rigid materials.
- Complexity and Finish: CNC milling can achieve superior surface finish and handle more complex geometries compared to some [[rapid prototyping]] methods, especially for hard materials.
