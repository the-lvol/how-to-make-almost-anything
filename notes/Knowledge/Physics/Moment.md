# Moment/Torque

$$
M = F \cdot d \\

M = \text{torque}, F = \text{force}, d = \text{distance}
$$

Also see [[Force]]

## Like Newton's Second Law
If the net moment is 0 the object does not rotate

$$
\sum{M} = I \cdot \alpha \\

\sum{M} = \text{Net torque}, I = \text{Inertia}, \alpha = \text{Angular acceleration}
$$
