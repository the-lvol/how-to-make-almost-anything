# Force
    A quantitative description of an interaction that causes a change in an object's motion

## Newton's Second Law
$$
\sum{F} = m \cdot a
\F = \text{Force in Newtons (N)}, m = \text{mass}, a = \text{acceleration}
$$

If the net force is 0, the object doesn't move

## Types of forces

### Gravity
$$
F = m \cdot g
$$

### Friction
$$
F = \mu \cdot N
$$

### Magnetic
No formula in the slides

### Springs
$$
F = k \cdot d
$$

### Drag

No formula in the slides

### Buoyancy
$$
F = p \cdot V \cdot g
$$
