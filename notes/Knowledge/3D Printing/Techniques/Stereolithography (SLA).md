A [[Additive Manufacturing]]

Stereolithography (SLA) is a 3D printing method that creates objects layer by layer using photochemical processes where light causes chemical monomers and oligomers to cross-link into polymers. Invented by Chuck Hull in 1984, it's used for models, prototypes, patterns, and parts production. SLA can rapidly produce complex designs but can be expensive. It's notable for its speed, ability to produce almost any design, and the quality of the parts which are strong enough for machining and as master patterns for various casting processes.


## Pros and Cons

### Advantages
- **Speed**: Functional parts can be manufactured within a day, with the time depending on the complexity and size of the design.
- **Quality**: SLA printed parts exhibit no significant anisotropy and lack a visible layering pattern, offering superior surface quality.
- **Strength**: Prototypes and designs are strong enough for machining and can be used to make master patterns for injection molding or metal casting processes.

### Disadvantages
- **Cost**: Historically costly, though prices are decreasing with public interest and technological advancements.
- **Material Handling**: Photopolymers used are sticky, messy, and require careful handling. Parts need to be washed, further cured, and dried post-production.
- **Environmental Impact**: The processes involved and the materials used (non-biodegradable resins) require more study to fully understand their environmental impact. Limited material choices compared to FFF, with no biodegradable or compostable resin options available.
