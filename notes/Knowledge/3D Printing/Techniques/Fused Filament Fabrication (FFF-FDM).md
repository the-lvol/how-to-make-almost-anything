Is a [[Additive Manufacturing]] method

Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) is a 3D printing process that utilizes a continuous filament of thermoplastic material. The filament is fed through a heated printer extruder head, melting and depositing it layer by layer to create a 3D object. This technique, also known by the trademarked term Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), was developed by S. Scott Crump and became widely accessible after the expiration of its patent in 2009. FFF is popular for hobbyist-grade 3D printing due to its cost-effectiveness compared to other methods like photopolymerization and powder sintering.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros:
- **Accessibility**: FFF is the most popular process for hobbyist-grade 3D printing, indicating high accessibility and community support.
- **Cost-effectiveness**: With the expiration of key patents, FFF technology has become significantly more affordable, leading to a dramatic price drop and making it accessible to a broader audience.
- **Material variety**: A wide range of thermoplastic materials can be used, including ABS, PLA, PETG, HIPS, TPU, and nylon, offering versatility in applications.
- **Open-source development**: The open-source movement, particularly through projects like RepRap, has spurred innovation and accessibility, allowing for customization and improvements by users.
- **Rapid prototyping**: Enables quick iteration and testing of designs, making it ideal for prototyping and small-scale manufacturing.

### Cons:
- **Print quality and precision**: Other techniques such as photopolymerisation and powder sintering may offer better results in terms of precision and surface finish.
- **Cost of alternative methods**: While FFF is cost-effective, higher-quality 3D printing methods remain much more costly, limiting access to advanced printing technologies for hobbyists and small businesses.
- **Material limitations**: Despite a variety of materials, there are limitations in the properties of printed objects, such as strength and temperature resistance, which can vary even with changes in filament color.
- **Overhang limitations**: FFF has restrictions on the slope of overhangs and cannot produce unsupported stalactites, which may limit design complexity.
- **Post-processing**: The text mentions missing information about post-processing needs (e.g., solvent smoothing, annealing), which can be critical for achieving desired surface quality and mechanical properties.

## Restrictions

### Overhangs
- If a print has larger overhangs support is needed
- This can be done in the same material or another if a 2-nozzle head is used
- Does take longer to print and uses more material

### [[Anisotropic Behavior]]
When printing the x and y directions are strong, but the z-direction is not as strong

### Printing Times
