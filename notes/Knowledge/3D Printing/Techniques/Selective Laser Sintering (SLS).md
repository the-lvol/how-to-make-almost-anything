# Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)
See [SLS - Selective Laser Sintering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_laser_sintering)

Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) is an [[Additive Manufacturing]] technique that uses a laser to sinter powdered material, typically nylon or polyamide, to create solid structures based on 3D models. Developed in the mid-1980s at the University of Texas at Austin, SLS allows for the production of complex geometries without the need for support structures, as the unsintered powder supports the item being printed. It's commonly used for [[Rapid Prototyping]] and low-volume production, with materials including plastics and metals. The technology offers advantages like the ability to produce complex parts with high strength and chemical resistance, but it also has disadvantages such as porous surfaces that may require post-processing.

## Pros and Cons 

### Pros
- **Self-supporting powder bed**: Allows for high overhanging angles and the construction of complex geometries embedded deep into parts, including conformal cooling channels.
- **Batch production**: Multiple parts can be produced in 3D arrays through a process called nesting, improving efficiency.
- **Material properties**: Parts possess high strength, stiffness, and good chemical resistance, with various finishing possibilities like metallization, stove enamel, and more.
- **Biocompatibility**: Meets EN ISO 10993-1 and USP/level VI/121 Â°C standards, making it suitable for medical applications.
- **No internal material trapping**: Complex parts with interior components can be built without altering the surface from support removal.
- **Speed**: One of the fastest additive manufacturing processes for printing functional, durable prototypes or end-user parts.
- **Material variety**: Offers a wide variety of materials that have characteristics of strength, durability, and functionality, allowing substitution for typical injection molding plastics.

### Cons
- **Porous surfaces**: Parts may have porous surfaces, requiring post-processing methods such as cyanoacrylate coatings or hot isostatic pressing to seal.
