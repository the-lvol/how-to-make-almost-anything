Laminated Object Manufacturing (LOM) is a [[Rapid Prototyping]] process developed by Helisys Inc. It involves layering adhesive-coated sheets of paper, plastic, or metal, which are then glued together and cut to shape using a knife or laser cutter. This technique allows for the creation of objects that can be modified by machining or drilling post-printing. LOM is noted for its cost-effectiveness, due to the use of readily available materials, and the ability to produce parts with wood-like characteristics from paper models. However, it has slightly less dimensional accuracy compared to stereolithography and [[Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)]].

## Pros and Cons

### Pros
- **Low cost**: Utilizes readily available raw materials such as adhesive-coated paper, plastic, or metal laminates, making it a cost-effective rapid prototyping system.
- **Material characteristics**: Paper models produced through LOM have wood-like characteristics, allowing them to be worked and finished similarly to wood.
- **No chemical reaction needed**: Enables the production of relatively large parts since the process does not require a chemical reaction.
- **Modification after printing**: Objects printed can be further modified by machining or drilling, offering flexibility in post-processing.
- **Layer resolution**: The typical layer resolution is comparable to the thickness of one to a few sheets of copy paper, which is adequate for a range of applications.

### Cons
- **Dimensional accuracy**: Offers slightly less dimensional accuracy compared to other rapid prototyping techniques like stereolithography and selective laser sintering.
- **Waste material**: The process involves cross-hatching non-part areas with a laser to facilitate waste removal, which may result in additional waste compared to other methods.
- **Limited to certain materials**: The effectiveness and efficiency of LOM might be limited to the types of materials (paper, plastic, or metal laminates) that can be used, potentially restricting the range of applications.
