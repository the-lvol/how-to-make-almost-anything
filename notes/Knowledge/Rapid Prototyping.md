# Rapid Prototyping
    A group of techniques used to quickly fabricate a scale model of a physical part or assembly using three-dimensional computer-aided design (CAD) data.

## Key Features:
- Speed: Allows for the fast creation of prototypes, reducing the development time of new products.
- Flexibility: Supports modifications and iterative design, enabling designers to quickly iterate and refine products.
- Technologies: Includes 3D printing, stereolithography (SLA), selective laser sintering (SLS), and fused deposition modeling (FDM).

## Applications:
Used in various industries including automotive, aerospace, medical, and consumer products to validate designs, perform functional testing, and gather user feedback.
