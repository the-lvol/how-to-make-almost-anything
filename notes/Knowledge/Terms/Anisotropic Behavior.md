# Anisotropic Behavior
    Anisotropic behavior describes the property of a material where its characteristics change depending on the direction from which it's measured. This is in contrast to isotropic behavior, where a material's properties are the same regardless of the measurement direction.

E.g. if a piece of paper is lying on a table, then pressing down on it doesn't alter its form but pressing it from the side makes it crumble together
