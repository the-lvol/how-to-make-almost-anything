# Autotrophic Self-Reproduction or Replication
The ability of a system to make a direct copy of itself from raw materials without assistance.  As yet, no artificial autotrophic self-reproducing kinematic machine has been made.  However, examples exist in biology (see Section 2).  For a kinematic machine to achieve autotrophic self-reproduction, it must contain a number of critical subsystems. One attempt to identify these subsystems was undertaken in Freitas and Merkle’s “Map of the Kinematic Replicator Design Space” in their comprehensive book [2], which identified 137 design properties in order for autotrophic self-reproduction to be possible

## Authropic Self-Reproducers
Remains an unachieved utopia
