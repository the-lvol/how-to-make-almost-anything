# Self-Reproduction
A process by which a kinematic machine can create an approximate copy of itself, perhaps with either insignificant or significant errors. All living organisms are self-reproducers. The "specified tolerances and works as well" (see [[Self-Replication]]) distinction between replication and reproduction follows through the definitions below, and the rest of this paper.

Replicators are a subset of reproducers
