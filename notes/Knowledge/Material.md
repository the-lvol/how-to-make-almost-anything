# Material

## digitization of Materials
An analog system would be like a 3D printer, where each piece is thrown out after use, while a digital system would be like Lego blocks, reused after they have been disassembled

This digitization idea, the reusable Lego blocks, is the main point

A [[3D Assembler]] would be a machine that utilizes this idea (as opposed to [[3D Printers]])
