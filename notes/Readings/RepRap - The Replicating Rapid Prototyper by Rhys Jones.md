## 1.2 Artificial Reproduction
Historical context of John von Neumann's work

### 1.2.2 [[Self-Assembly]] [[Kinetic Machine]]
Possible and done, but has not been used in large-scale projects

### 1.2.3 [[Self-Manufacturing]] [[Kinetic Machine]]
Limited research but two fundamental models have been identified

#### **Unit Growth**
- Definition: A system composed of multiple sub-assemblies capable of manufacturing and assembling all required sub-components until resources deplete.
- Key Insight: Inspired by von Neumann's observation, any sufficiently equipped machine shop can function as a self-manufacturing unit growth system.
- Mechanism: Utilizes existing machinery and resources to expand its manufacturing capabilities.

#### **Unit Replication**
- Definition: A system where a single device can manufacture all its parts, aiming for complete self-replication.
- Advantages: Potential for significant compactness, making it suitable for household implementation.
- Current Status: Not yet achieved, primarily due to the limitations of traditional manufacturing tools that are designed for specific tasks (e.g., a lathe for axial cutting), limiting the design possibilities for a single machine.
- Challenges: Achieving self-manufacturing in the unit replication model requires the development of highly versatile manufacturing technologies.

#### Key Differences:
- Scale and Complexity: The unit growth model relies on a network of sub-assemblies, whereas the unit replication model focuses on the self-sufficiency of a single device.
- Potential Applications: The unit growth model is more aligned with industrial-scale manufacturing, while the unit replication model has the potential to decentralize manufacturing to the level of individual households, pending technological advancements.

## 2 The Genesis Of RepRap
A long and windy talk about how the machine is inspired by nature

## 3 The First RepRap machine
- Used [[rapid prototyping]] over [[Computer Numerical Control (CNC) Milling]]
- Laser, etc. could not be used as they weren't self replicating

### 3.1 Extruder design
